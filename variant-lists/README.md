This folder has lists of candidate variants/pathogenic variants/variants of interest.

Please note that these have been manually curated and you should check to see whether your variants of interest are covered. 
Also the consensus for pathogenicity of variants changes over time.

Also these are using the SNP names from the unimputed data. If you have imputed your data (and you need to to get coverage of certain variants in GBA) you should extract using SNP positions and not these names.

The PD_snps_expanded list is not all pathogenic variants, includes some variants of interest (curated by John Harvey and Manuela).

The pd_snps_pathogenic list has been curated from PDmutDB and is just pathogenic PD variants, but this was created around 2017/2018 so may need to be updated.
